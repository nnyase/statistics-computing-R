## question 1



```{r question 1}

n.sam <- 1000
x.sam <- rexp(n.sam,5)


# method 1
g <- function(x){ (x^2)}
# compute the MC approximation
theta.mc <- mean(sapply(x.sam, g))
print(theta.mc)

# method 2
mean(x.sam^2)


```

```{r part 2}

variance <- function(x,x_means) { (x-x_means)^2}

n.sam <- 1000
x.sam <- rexp(n.sam,5)
x_mean <- mean(x.sam)
exp_variance <- mean(sapply(x.sam,variance, x_mean))

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
