# QUESTION 1
```{r QUESTION 1}
X <- rexp(1000,rate = 5)
n_sizes <- seq(from=5, by=15, length.out=500)
n_sizes
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
